# Task List API

## Skills Assessed

- Following directions and reading comprehension
- Reading, writing, and using tests
- Demonstrating understanding of the client-server model, request-response cycle and conventional RESTful routes
- Driving development with independent research, experimentation, and collaboration
- Reading and using existing external web APIs
- Using Postman as part of the development workflow

- Reading query parameters to create custom behavior
- Create unconventional routes for custom behavior
- Apply knowledge about making requests in Python, to call an API inside of an API

## Goals

There's so much we want to do in the world! When we organize our goals into smaller, bite-sized tasks, we'll be able to track them more easily, and complete them!

If we make a web API to organize our tasks, we'll be able to create, read, update, and delete tasks as long as we have access to the Internet and our API is running!

We also want to do some interesting features with our tasks. We want to be able to:

- Sort tasks
- Mark them as complete
- Get feedback about our task list through Slack
- Organize tasks with goals

... and more!

## How to Complete and Submit
